# Overview



This is a web app companion for the dice game Addiction. It includes a page giving a description of how to play the game as well as a tracker that keeps track of the score based on user input of what they rolled.


The most frustrating part of this game is often doing the simple arithmetic especially when the score gets higher than around 30. The web app does the arithmetic and keeps track of the score as well as some other useful info such as round and number of rolls entered.

# Development Environment

When you run the server you go to localhost:8000 to view it.

I used primarily Django in VS code. Django is in python. I also used some HTML and just a tiny bit of CSS for some simple formatting.
